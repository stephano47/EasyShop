# EasyShop
# ____________________

I have been assigned to update an existing e-commerce application implementing new methods and fixing bugs reported by the users of the application.
 

## Features:
# ____________________

## Bug Fixes:
### Search Function:
You may have noticed that the product search was returning incorrect results. We've fixed this issue, so you should now get the correct products when searching.

### Duplication of Items:
Some products were appearing duplicated with only minimal differences. This was due to the method using create instead of update.

## Bugs Identified:
1. **Category Load Failure**:
   - I noticed while testing the EasyShop site that occasionally, the category loading might fail.
   - If this happens, refreshing the page fixes the issue.
   - This happens whenever I went into the cart section for a couple of seconds then head back into the home screen.
