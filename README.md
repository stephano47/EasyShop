## Version 2 Update - Year Up Capstone 3
# ____________________

**I have been tasked with updating the EasyShop e-commerce platform by fixing reported bugs and implementing updates to ensure a smoother and more efficient shopping experience for users.**

# ____________________

## Bug Fixes:
### Search Function:
While reviewing the reported bugs, I noticed that the product search was returning incorrect results. I’ve addressed this issue, and you should now see accurate results when searching.

### Duplication of Items:
Some products were appearing duplicated with only minimal differences. This was due to the method using create instead of update.

## Bugs Identified:
1. **Category Load Failure**:
   - I noticed while testing the EasyShop site that occasionally, the category loading might fail.
   - If this happens, refreshing the page fixes the issue.
   - This happens whenever I went into the cart section for a couple of seconds then head back into the home screen.
